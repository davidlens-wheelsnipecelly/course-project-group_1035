## Milestones

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{This data set includes the flight delays in the United States in the months of January, February, and March of 2015 for each day. It includes the airline invloved, tail number of the a/c, origin, destination, scheduled arrival/departure time, taxi times etc. The data was recorded for each flight through their dispatch services and uploaded to a common database. The purpose of this datadet is out of pure interest, as we get variable delays due to holidays, weather, events that occur during these different months.}

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{This data set is quite interesting as it gives us insight to a few questions; like what times of the month are buisiest (holidays, weekends, etc.), what airlines are most prone to delays, what airports are most delayed, what the average times for delays are, the time of day delays are most common, etc. While this data set only covers a few months, it can give us and others insight to the delay trends of airlines, airports, and times there are the most delays. This dataset would be very intersting to see it represented visually in different formats.}
